Welcome! <ins>**_THIS IS A GUIDE TO GETTING STARTED WITH FERRIS!!1!11!1_**</ins>

Ferris is a Discord bot for protecting and maintaining your Discord servers.

In order to get the best experience, you should be using Ferris with the web panel and the Discord bot in your server.

With that, let's get started.

## Step 1

Add Ferris to the Discord Server.

You can do this through the button at the top of the page.

## Step 2

Log into the [Control Panel](/api/login).

Once you log in with Discord and select a server for Ferris to operate in, you can easily manage the server with our fancy web panel.

## Step 3

Set up Ferris.

From here, you can configure [Logging](/docs/logging/introduction) and [Punishments](/docs/punishments/introduction). There are some settings that aren't configured right off the bat; you can learn how to set up an entire environment for your staff team to work together at [Logging](/docs/logging/introduction) and [Punishments](/docs/punishments/introduction).

Using the control panel will give you the best desktop experience. Mobile users will find that directly giving Ferris commands in the Discord server is a better option.

That's it! You're done. Getting started with Ferris is easy and painless, much like managing your servers after you add Ferris to them!
