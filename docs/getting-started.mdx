## Introduction

Welcome to the Ferris Getting Started Guide! First things first,

Ferris is a Discord Bot created for protecting and maintaining Discord Servers.

In order to get the best experience, Ferris is best used alongside the web panel, as well as the discord bot within your server.

With that, lets get started.

## Step 1

Add Ferris to the Discord Server.

The easiest way to do this is through the button on the header of the screen.

## Step 2

Log into the [Control Panel](/api/login).

By logging in using Discord, and selecting the server you want Ferris to operate on, you can manage the server using our complete and full web panel.

## Step 3

From here, you can configure [Logging](/docs/logging/introduction) and [Punishments](/docs/punishments/introduction). Using the control panel will give you the best experience, if you're on mobile however, the better option would be to use commands within the discord server.

And that's it! Getting started with Ferris is easy and painless, just like most other bots. There are some settings that aren't configured off the bat. Using the links above you can learn how to set up a whole environment for your staff team to work together.
